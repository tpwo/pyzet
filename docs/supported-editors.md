# Supported editors

CLI editors like vim or nano should work out of the box without the need
of passing any `editor_args`. For GUI editors you almost always are
expected to pass some args. Below is the list with some tested editors.

**TIP:** if your editor is not listed, you can search how to set it up as
Git's commit message editor. It's almost certain that if such editor
works with Git with certain args, it will work with pyzet when the same
args are used.

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* If `code` is not available in your `PATH`, you need to pass the full
  path to it (it's in `bin/` folder of VS Code installation)

* If you open VS Code instance in your `zet` folder, then this instance
  will always be preferred

* You can add `--new-window` arg to always open a new VS Code instance,
  but this might be a bit slow

* Works well with WSL2

```yaml
editor: code
editor_args: [--wait]
```

## [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

* Works well with WSL2

```yaml
editor: C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe
editor_args: [-multiInst, -notabbar, -nosession, -noPlugin]
```

## [Geany](https://www.geany.org/)

```yaml
editor: C:/Program Files/Geany/bin/geany.exe
editor_args: [--new-instance, --no-msgwin, --no-ctags, --no-session]
```
